# Globals in Ruby

```ruby
$regular_global_variable = 'some data'

Constant = { key: 'value' }

module Namespace
  HiddenNotHidden = :value

class MyClass

# *Working with Ruby Threads* by Jesse Storimer

**thx Josh Mills**

"Thread safety" chapter gets right into race conditions, mutexes, etc.

 - Let's avoid making our own threads in application code.

"Writing Thread-Safe Code" chapter sez:

- "Idiomatic Ruby code is most often thread-safe Ruby code."
- "Avoid mutating globals"

# "Does the GIL make your Ruby code thread-safe?"

**thx Josh Mills**

This is a great tutorial on how Ruby's threads work.

# rubocop-thread_safety

https://github.com/covermymeds/rubocop-thread_safety

Some initial feedback has been: Rubocop can't possibly be sufficient.

 - very high bang for buck
 - 80/20 rule
 - hopefully more like 99/1 in this case
 - help me identify the types of problems rubocop can't find

# New Cop

`ThreadSafety/InstanceVariableInClassMethod`

```ruby
class FollowupFaxer
  def self.fax(params)
    @params = params
    validate(@params)
    send_fax(@params)
  end
end
```

---

# New Cop

`ThreadSafety/ClassAndModuleAttributes`

```ruby
class User
  cattr_accessor :current_user
end
```

---

# Other Cops

 - `ThreadSafety/NewThread`
 - `Style/GlobalVars`
 - `Style/ClassVars`
 - `Style/MutableConstant`

---

# Class IVar as a Cache

```ruby
def self.id_for(short_desc)
  @cache_of_ids             ||= {}
  @cache_of_ids[short_desc] ||= find_by_short_description!(short_desc).id
end
```

--

count: false

```ruby
@cache_of_ids ||= {}
```
is the same as
```ruby
@cache_of_ids = @cache_of_ids || {}
```
